Learning 6502 assembly language

I stumbled upon some retro gaming and retro computing YouTube channels and had an interest 
in 6502 assembly language. So this repository is mainly just for some experiments and learning 
purposes. Maybe it will turn into an actual useful project, but for now it's just for fun.
